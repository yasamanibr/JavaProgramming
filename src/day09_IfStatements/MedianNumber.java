/*
2. Create a class called MedianNumber. write a program that can find the median number between three DIFFERENT given integers
			Ex:
				a = 10, b= 15, c = 20;
			Output:
				15 is the median number
			Possibility #1: a could be median number
			Possibility #2: b could be median number
			Possibility #3: c could be median number
